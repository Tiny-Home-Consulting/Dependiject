## Checklist

- [ ] I searched the [existing GitHub issues][1] and this hasn't already been requested.

## Problem

<!--
    What's the problem you have that this feature would solve? This is different from the exact
    feature itself -- describe the underlying problem that led you to request this feature.
-->

## Feature Request

<!--
    What is the feature you want to see added to the library? Code samples showing how it would be
    used are appreciated, but not required. The more detail you can provide, the better. 
-->

## Value

<!--
    Why should it be part of this library? Explain the benefits of adding this to Dependiject
    instead of another library or the app code.
-->
