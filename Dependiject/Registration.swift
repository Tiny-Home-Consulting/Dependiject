// MARK: Protocol
/// A single entry in the factory's registrations list.
///
/// Generally you don't use this directly, and instead create a ``Service``. You use a custom
/// conformance to this protocol when the provided scopes are insufficient for your use case.
///
/// For example, the following registration uses a boolean variable to determine when to re-use the
/// existing instance:
/// ```swift
/// class CustomRegistration: Registration {
///     let type: Any.Type
///     let name: String?
///     let callback: (Resolver) -> Any
///
///     var shouldReuse: Bool
///     private var instance: Any?
///
///     func resolve(_ resolver: Resolver) -> Any {
///         if shouldReuse,
///            let instance = self.instance {
///             return instance
///         } else {
///             instance = callback(resolver)
///             return instance!
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// Although reference semantics are not required -- that is, the custom registration can be a
/// struct rather than a class -- the `resolve(_:)` method must be non-mutating for value types.
