// MARK: Struct Declaration
/// A service that is exposed under multiple protocols.
///
/// This is for the use case that you have a single object, but want to expose only parts of it to
/// different parts of the application.
///
/// ### General Usage
///
/// In the following example, there's one class `StateManager` responsible for managing some shared
/// piece of state, which is exposed to different parts of the code under the protocols
/// `StateAccessor` and `StateUpdater`:
/// ```swift
/// Factory.register {
///     MultitypeService(exposedAs: [StateAccessor.self, StateUpdater.self]) { _ in
///         StateManager()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// As this type of registration only works as expected for reference types, the callback must
/// return an object (as opposed to a struct). If Swift cannot or does not correctly infer the
/// generic type, you may explicitly specify (e.g. `MultitypeService<StateManager>` rather than just
/// `MultitypeService`).
///
/// ### Exposing the Implementation Type
///
/// By default, the original type is hidden. In the example above,
/// `Factory.shared.resolve(StateManager.self)` would fail. If resolving the original type is
/// desired, you may add the class itself to the type array:
/// ```swift
/// MultitypeService(exposedAs: [StateAccessor.self, StateUpdater.self, StateManager.self]) { _ in
///     StateManager()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Usage with Named Dependencies
///
/// As with ``Service``, a MultitypeService may give its registrations names.
///
/// To use the same name for the dependency regardless of which interface is being resolved, use
/// ``init(exposedAs:name:callback:)`` or ``init(exposedAs:name:_:)``:
/// ```swift
/// Factory.register {
///     MultitypeService(
///         exposedAs: [StateAccessor.self, StateUpdater.self],
///         name: "MyStateManager"
///     ) { _ in
///         StateManager()
///     }
/// }
///
/// let myStateAccessor = Factory.shared.resolve(StateAccessor.self, name: "MyStateManager")
/// let myStateUpdater = Factory.shared.resolve(StateUpdater.self, name: "MyStateManager")
/// ```
///
/// To use a different name for each interface, use ``init(exposedAs:callback:)`` or
/// ``init(exposedAs:_:)``. Specify `nil` to allow the type to be resolved without a name:
/// ```swift
/// Factory.register {
///     MultitypeService(exposedAs: [
///         StateAccessor.self: nil,
///         StateUpdater.self: "MyStateUpdater"
///     ]) { _ in
///         StateManager()
///     }
/// }
///
/// let myStateAccessor = Factory.shared.resolve(StateAccessor.self)
/// let myStateUpdater = Factory.shared.resolve(StateUpdater.self, name: "MyStateUpdater")
/// ```
