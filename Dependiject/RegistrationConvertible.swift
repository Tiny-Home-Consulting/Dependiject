/// An object or structure that can produce a `Registration`.
///
/// If you wanted to, for example, use different names for different scopes (instead of calling them
/// all `Service`), you could write custom implementations such as the following:
/// ```swift
/// struct Singleton: RegistrationConvertible {
///     private let service: Service
///
///     var registration: Registration {
///         return service.registration
///     }
///
///     init<T>(_ type: T.Type, _ callback: @escaping (Resolver) -> T) {
///         self.service = Service(.singleton, type, callback)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// Then, you can use your custom type in ``Factory/register(builder:)``:
/// ```swift
/// Factory.register {
///     Singleton(DependencyProtocol.self) { _ in
///         DependencyClass()
///     }
/// }
/// ```
public protocol RegistrationConvertible {
    /// The wrapped registration object.
    /// - Note: The default implementation is only available for types that adopt `Registration`.
    var registration: Registration { get }
}

// Default implementation for RegistrationConvertible, so that Registration classes don't need to
// implement it.
public extension RegistrationConvertible
where Self: Registration {
    var registration: Registration {
        return self
    }

/// The different lifecycles for dependencies that are provided by default.
///
/// This is meant to be used with ``Service/init(_:_:name:_:)``; each case describes a different way
/// of determining when the callback should be called vs. when the previous return value should be
/// re-used.
public struct Scope: Equatable, Sendable {
    internal let value: UnderlyingType
    
    /// Call the provided callback every time the dependency is requested.

    /// - Note: This scope is for singletons that are created by the callback. If the singleton is
    /// created elsewhere, use ``Service/init(constant:_:name:)`` instead.
    public static let singleton = Scope(value: .singleton)
    /// Re-use an existing instance if it exists, but do not hold onto an unused instance.
